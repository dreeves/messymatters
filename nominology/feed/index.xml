					<description><![CDATA[nominology is better than onomastics.  Nominologists here seem to agree.  Everyone please continue to use it.  Why?  It maintains the pattern / principle / rule (nomological precept) of using the -logy suffix, and it uses the most obvious translation of English&#039;s name (v,n) to Greek&#039;s nym, not ónoma - which I believe might even be better suited and sourced as fame and reputation, etymologically.  We also need to differentiate -nastic from -logic, but not here, now.

Also, redirecting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomastics to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominology would help, but it&#039;s not necessary.  Just a mention is enough for today.  Here, even.  It seems like a widely held view to me that nominology works better for our needs.]]></description>
