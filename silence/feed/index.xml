					<description><![CDATA[there are two big differences between image and music: first, image is 2 dimensional but music is 1 dimensional.  so after removing a fraction of the data points, the 2 dimensional image is &quot;more connected&quot; than the 1 dimensional song.  second, you have random access to an image when you look at it, but you experience music as a stream.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@John Cox, are you saying you can identify the nursery rhyme on that page?  I couldn&#039;t, even after training on all the example sentences.

This reminds me of another interesting phenomenon: priming. If you made up some snippet of speech that matched the rhythm in that example I would think I was hearing it plain as day.  Here&#039;s a funny example: http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1944]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This reminds me of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/home/Chris_Darwin/SWS/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sine-wave speech distortions&lt;/a&gt;.

The linked page has a table of audio snippets. Recordings in the right column contain a sentence of speech, one per row. The middle column contains that same sentence, distorted. Can you tell what the sentence is for each row without listening to the recording on the right?

If not, listen to the original and then listen to the distorted recording in the middle again. With this new information you&#039;ll make out the distorted recordings easily. I also found that after cheating on the first two sentences I was able to identify the rest without listening to the original. My brain rapidly got better at teasing speech out of this particular deformation.

The amount of processing your brain does to &#039;raw&#039; sensory input before you consciously perceive it is really surprising.

(Also, I wonder how possible it would be to identify the Bach fugue at the beginning of Bad Romance if you replaced 90% of it with silence. It&#039;s already hard to recognize because it&#039;s played so fast.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t think it was that easy.  I had my class help me.
We came up with:
1.  Hey Jude - Beetles
2.  ?Sounded like a choir?
3.  Aretha Franklin - Respect
4.  ?We thought of an old rock song?
5.  Bad Romance - Lady GaGa]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kevin: Wow, nice job! Are you up for a bonus challenge? &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.messymatters.com/silence/song6_5_prct.mp3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mystery Song #6&lt;/a&gt; is 95% silence: you hear one-tenth of a second of music for every &lt;strong&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt; seconds of play time. Can you name that tune?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I did one listenthrough.  The only one I actually got was Aretha, although I could figure out bits of other stuff (meaning genres, i.e. Ode to Joy was obviously a large orchestral choral piece.  Also I thought the Beatles sounded like Rivers Cuomo, which is unsurprising). 

One thing I found interesting: even though I told myself I was trying to figure out what the songs were, my brain was all like &quot;let&#039;s see if we can use our musical knowledge to predict what&#039;s coming next instead!&quot;]]></description>
