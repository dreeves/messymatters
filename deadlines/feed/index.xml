					<description><![CDATA[Come to think of it, it fits nicely with David Reiley&#039;s principle, where he has a deadline for a draft that forces you to mostly get it done by one date and then finish it by another deadline.

Speaking of which, you may have noticed that our Beeminder graph for Messy Matters posts is currently flat. The plan is to steepen it again at the end of the month. Sharad didn&#039;t want to tweet a draft of his upcoming post.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Dave, I don&#039;t think so. Most students stuck to the nominal deadline and some took advantage of the effective 2-day grace period. I think any time a student went beyond that it was for reasons other than akrasia (&quot;one more second won&#039;t hurt&quot;) though I&#039;m not certain of that.

My sense is that it gets so steep so fast that you really have to treat 2 days late as a pretty hard deadline. I think psychologically it works well since you really do want to hit the nominal deadline and not take that 1% hit, so you take that deadline fairly seriously, and then you get a 2-day buffer if you really need it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice post and great idea. The curve looks potentially dangerous to the procrastinator in me: literally a slippery slope. Did some students fall into the trap of delaying more than they should since each additional second delay is, by itself, &quot;not so bad&quot;?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Have you considered giving rewards for turning in work early as opposed to penalties for late work? You know, the whole positive versus negative motivation thing... I was on the receiving end of this with apartment rental: they didn&#039;t say that you are getting a penalty for paying 2 weeks late, but rather that you are getting a discount for paying on time.]]></description>
