					<description><![CDATA[Good article...we see many long tail searches and conversion on many of those terms is usually higher.

Facebook&#039;s open graph protocol has real potential to impact the way we search and choose specific items like movies and music.  By passing through that all powerful &quot;recommended or liked by a friend&quot; information we get to see not only what items look interesting to us, we get to see what items our friends &quot;liked&quot;.  The same goes for Google&#039;s plus one.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Morgan says:
&quot;The internet definitely plays a huge role in the success of the long tail phenomenon. The only gripe I have with Chris is that he used absolute numbers to come up with the figures for this study. I believe that the head and tail would be better off being defined as a percentage.&quot;

I agree. Using a percentage makes the head and tail area a little easier to grasp but the concept is still sound and it&#039;s a facinating article for marketers. Thank you]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One thing to keep in mind is that sites like Amazon and Netflix make it easier to dig into the long tail with their recommendations. I&#039;m not sure people are like sheep so much as not have the time it takes to find &quot;long tail&quot; music/movies on their own. By providing these recommendations based on a person&#039;s previous selections, they make it easier to find music, movies, books, etc. that they probably would not have come across otherwise.]]></description>
