					<description><![CDATA[Found this on the web somewhere, from a book called &quot;Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
    Imagine that you&#039;ve got a ten-year-old minivan that needs a new transmission. The sunk cost fallacy tells us that you&#039;re more likely to plunk down the money for the new transmission if you&#039;ve recently sunk hundreds or thousands on repairs into your clunker before that. So ask yourself: If someone gave you that minivan as a gift yesterday, would you spend the money today to get it running? If the answer is &quot;no&quot; -- because that large an investment is not worth it on its merit -- then it&#039;s probably time to think about buying a new car.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@pauljung: Thanks, yes, I see the ambiguity now.  Replacing &quot;driving&quot; with &quot;in a car&quot; is better.

@klochner: Point taken but I&#039;d emphasize that it&#039;s only the size of the pot as whole that matters, not the specific amount you contributed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[re: pot-invested - the more common term is &quot;pot committed&quot;, which is a rational statement.   It isn&#039;t a classic sunk cost situation because the money you&#039;ve put into the pot isn&#039;t &quot;spent&quot;, and the value of calling is dependent on how much you&#039;ve put in.   Let&#039;s say you&#039;re deciding between call and fold.  The value of a call is: v(call) = p(win&#124;call)*v(win) - p(lose&#124;call)*v(lose), where v(win) = v(pot), v(lose) = amount to call.  This is commonly referred to as getting &quot;pot odds&quot;:
  
If I estimate my chance of winning at 1%, with $1 to call and pot size of $1000, I&#039;m clearly pot-committed.

					<description><![CDATA[While taking this quiz I was torn on #1 since I wasn&#039;t clear on the statement. To clear things up I think a better phrasing would be:
“I would only spend that much time in a car to save the flight costs but since the flight is paid for I’d rather take it.”

The ambiguities of the statement as it is: (1) Is there a cost to the actual &quot;driving&quot;? On a road trip, it is not clear who will be driving.  (2) Is that the ONLY reason the person would drive? There could be a high and positive utility of taking a trip with friends. For example I could imagine the following continuations of the phrase &quot;I might do that much driving to save the flight costs&quot;:

I might do that much driving to save the flight costs; I might also do that much driving to hang out with friends and go sight-seeing along the way.

or better yet

I might do that much driving to save the flight costs; I would definitely do that much driving to hang out with friends.]]></description>
