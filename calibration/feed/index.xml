					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/calibration/#comment-185011&quot;&gt;Joe&lt;/a&gt;.

It&#039;s true. Andrew Gelman made that point here in the comments as well. I guess for this version you&#039;re on your honor to not do that. You could mitigate that problem by asking the questions one at a time and not revealing how many will be coming. It&#039;s actually a really interesting question how to make the incentives exactly right. I&#039;ll leave that as an exercise for the reader!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is a fundamental problem with these types of quiz games. I can win all the time by simply having 9 huge, absolutely safe intervals (Mozart was born between the Big Bang and today, etc.) and for a single question I give a blatantly wrong answer, like 1-2 nanometers for the Moon&#039;s diameter.]]></description>

sorry i am not a numbers person but have this as a homework assignment for behavioral finance what did you put for best guess? The correct answer?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is the expected result, but I thought it would apply to others, but not to me, since I knew the literature.  More proof education is not a cure ;)

I&#039;m trying to think about this in the context of the Delphi forecasting technique, which asks people for their forecast and their 90% confidence interval. One method of combining forecasts is to combine by the inverse of the expected error variance; but that&#039;s completely wrong if those with a narrow confidence interval aren&#039;t the most knowledgeable, just the most overconfident.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tg: Don&#039;t feel embarrassed that you didn&#039;t cheat like Andrew :). The point of the exercise is introspection, not &quot;winning&quot;. I guess this is a case in point of misaligned incentives!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tg:

I cheated.  I gave nine intervals as (-infinity, +infinity) and one interval as (0,0).  After all, the request was to be _perfectly calibrated_, not merely to be calibrated in expectation!  This was the only way I could be sure of getting &quot;90% of my intervals (no more, no less)&quot; to contain the true values.]]></description>
