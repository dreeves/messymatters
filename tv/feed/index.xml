					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/tv/#comment-230399&quot;&gt;David Rutter&lt;/a&gt;.

Great question! Our mechanism is similar to a Vickrey auction in that the 2nd highest bid is used as the price, but it&#039;s different in that there&#039;s no 3rd-party seller. The good is jointly owned and the payment will go from one player to the other. So our decision auctions are not strictly incentive compatible like Vickrey is (though in practice it seems to be close enough). If you&#039;re *very* interested I can tell you the Nash equilibrium for a decision auction (with unrealistic assumptions about type distributions).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wouldn&#039;t the simplest answer to both of questions 8 and 9 be simply &quot;Vickrey auctions are honest&quot;? Actually, now that I look at it, this argument has some difficulty adapting to decision auctions. I feel like it can be adapted, at least in expectation. I&#039;ll be thinking about it. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction#Proof_of_dominance_of_truthful_bidding]]></description>

Thanks Emanuel! Fixed now. I might owe you $20 for that, though it was kind of intentional at the time. I made a ton of edits since I hit publish on this seconds before the deadline. I&#039;m definitely still honoring the $20 typo bounty, btw, for anything that&#039;s unambiguously an error.]]></description>
