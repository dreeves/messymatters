					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Forecasting: Forecast generation occurs simultaneously with trading. An outcome’s share price is interpreted as the odds of that event occuring.

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Prediction markets are held to generate accurate odds, informing users how likely it is that a given market’s outcome will occur. Augur is a platform where users can create and participate in prediction markets. Within the system of smart contracts, users wager on the outcome they believe will take place, winning money when correct and losing money when incorrect. At any given time, an outcome’s share price can be interpreted as an estimate of the probability of that event occuring. Prediction market advocates claim such estimates are accurate, or are superior to other forms of forecasting, such as experts, models, or polling. Studies cited by Augur include ‘The Real Power of Artificial Markets’ (2001) and ‘Predictions Without Markets’ (2010). [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Top tier sports, national elections, and Hollywood releases are all arenas in which all the information one might analyze is already pretty much public.  There are many methods for predicting these outcomes, and I wouldn&#039;t argue that Prediction Markets have a huge advantage in these arenas.  The markets where I expect PMs to have an advantage are where there are experts who, given an incentive, could share (or discover) information that&#039;s not already public, and where you don&#039;t already have an enormous crowd trying to figure out the answer.  Certainly it&#039;s fun to bet on your team or party, or to develop expertise on how the public will react to particular movies, but it&#039;s not clear to me that we get better predictions in those areas.

This is also one of my criticisms of the Servan-Schreiber paper.  While I believe  there are probably markets in which the availability of serious money to be won could attract people who&#039;d be willing to spend research in order to get a better answer, NFL sports isn&#039;t an arena where spending thousands of dollars will help you uncover facts that aren&#039;t already in the mainstream media.

When we talk about CEO markets, or product release dates, or market penetration numbers, we&#039;re talking about markets in which the information isn&#039;t already out there, and some people will spend time and effort to ferret out relevant facts for reputation (we see this often on Foresight Exchange) or money.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for an interesting paper. As a political scientist I will comment on your discussion on political predictions:
I would question the validity in analyzing entertainment and sports events to make claims about the accuracy of political elections. You indeed acknowledge this in the paper, but maintain your claim that this paper has relevance for political forecasts (by referring to other studies). I disagree with this approach.

I think the dynamics of elections - which as a rule take place every four years or so - are much harder to capture by using statistical models than sports events are. They occur less frequently, and in very different contexts. What can the outcome of a presidential election in 1948 tell us about the outcome in 2012? A little bit, perhaps, but not much. Traders in prediction markets pay much more attention to the particular context every election takes place, and I believe this is one of the strengths of this method.

Understanding why voters vote the way they do is very hard to capture, especially in advance(!). Wlezien and Erikson claim that polls adjusted with some structural variables are equally good or better than market predictions. That may be true, but if I remember correctly that analysis was made after the result was known, which is another playing field. 

I will gladly endorse another method if it outperforms prediciton markets in accuracy, but so far they have been the best tool in predicting the vote ex-ante. Once the market is up an running it is also cost-efficient for the organizer, and produces continuously updated predictions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice to have more data points showing that prediction markets are not superior to other alternative forecasting methods. All the examples in the paper have a &quot;large&quot; sample, however, if you had a relatively &quot;small&quot; amount of data, which forecasting model would you choose? Prediction markets or something else?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Robin Hanson:  It&#039;s true that the relative advantage of prediction markets may be more pronounced in other domains.  Indeed, when we first analyzed the football data we thought maybe football games are just particularly unpredictable.  (Quoting ourselves from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cam.cornell.edu/~sharad/papers/pred-wo-markets.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the paper&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;it is possible that football remains a special case even in the domain of sports in that outcomes are dominated by hard to anticipant events---a hail Mary pass in the final minutes, for example, or an intercepted ball against the flow of play---for which there is relatively little real information on which to base sophisticated predictions.&quot;)

Prediction markets for baseball, we predicted, would perform better.  Many more statistics are gathered for baseball and conventional wisdom has it that many variables like pitching rotation and recent batting performance of individual players need to be accounted for in predicting game outcomes.  But again, simple statistical models that ignore all that do essentially as well as the market.

So maybe sports in general are an exception?  That&#039;s why we decided to try another domain that prediction market advocates have pointed to to showcase their efficacy: predicting box office revenue for movies.  Same story.

And as we&#039;ve been discussing in the comments above, for political elections it&#039;s deja vu all over again.

So I think you&#039;re making a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;God of the Gaps&lt;/a&gt; argument here.

As for the plots, we evaluate the prediction methods on RMSE and discrimination as well as calibration in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cam.cornell.edu/~sharad/papers/pred-wo-markets.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the paper&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>
