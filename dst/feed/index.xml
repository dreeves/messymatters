					<description><![CDATA[I think Arizona is the exception that proves the rule (in the classical sense). If it weren&#039;t for DST then, to take advantage of all the sunlight, people would need to do recreational activities before work in the morning. Only in places like Arizona is that reasonable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used to live in Arizona, where we didn&#039;t use DST.  That made sense because people preferred to get up early and do recreation in the mornings in summer, since evenings are generally too hot.   Even remembering whether we were 2 versus 3 hours&#039; difference from the East Coast is a bit taxing mentally, I still think it was worth it not to have DST there.  

I also think it is totally worth it to have DST in California and the other six states I&#039;ve lived in, where the heat problem is not so bad (though I don&#039;t doubt that this costs us some air-conditioning expenses).

It&#039;s interesting to see on the map how equatorial countries are much less likely to adopt DST than other latitudes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Bill Walsh: When you say &quot;during DST, people spend more time at home during hotter parts of the day,&quot; I hear: &quot;during DST, people spend more time *not at work* when *the sun is shining*.&quot;  So that&#039;s good.  

As for energy efficiency I was thinking that starting the day earlier in the summer means you need to keep the lights on for one less hour at night.  I don&#039;t doubt that you&#039;re right that the work/home air conditioner asymmetry swamps that though.  Interesting.  Still not worth keeping business hours later in the day though!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Continuously-updated daylight savings adjustments are less likely than The Singularity, IMHO of course.  

Clocks, and even more so wristwatches, present the current time while also serving as fashion statements.  It&#039;s not likely going to be soon that people are ready to abandon their antique time pieces.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually, studies have shown that DST is less energy efficient. The reason is that air conditioning costs more than electric lights. During DST, people spend more time at home during hotter parts of the day, thus using more air conditioning. Unfortunately this is not offset because the offices generally do not adjust air conditioning when workers leave.

That said, I personally prefer DST and wish we just kept it going all year long.]]></description>
