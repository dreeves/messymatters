					<description><![CDATA[The modern Summer Olympic Games have been held every four years since the first Games in 1896 and Olympic records are recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in each event. The athletics events, which take place at each Games, are divided into four groups: track events (including sprints, middle- and long-distance running, hurdling and relays), field events (including javelin, discus, hammer, pole vault, long and triple jumps), road events (such as walks and the marathon) and combined events (the heptathlon and the decathlon). Women compete in 23 athletics events during the Games, and men compete in 24; while 21 of the events are the same for both men and women, men exclusively compete in the 50 km walk, the women&#039;s combined event is the heptathlon while the men compete in the decathlon, and the short distance hurdles for women is contested over 100 m, ten metres shorter than the men&#039;s event.

					<description><![CDATA[I did a big study in 1997 showing that the most of the decline in the gender gap in Olympic running from 1976 through 1988 was due to steroids (i.e., artificial male hormones) having a bigger bang for the buck in women than in men. After Ben Johnson got caught at the 1988 Olympics and other runners got worried about getting caught, the gender gap got bigger. To break Flo-Jo&#039;s 1988 women&#039;s records would require a serious advance in doping technology.

&quot;Track &#038;  Battlefield: Everybody knows that the &quot;gender gap&quot; between men and women runners in the Olympics is narrowing. Everybody is wrong.&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m wondering if the consistency of the male/female gap is good evidence that the social/discriminatory hurdles have been overcome and the gap is pure biology. (No one doubts that there&#039;s a biological gap, of course, just not clear whether the 10-15% gap among Olympians is all biology.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On the topic of fitting curves to olympic times, there was a study picked up by Nature in 2004, &quot;Athletics: Momentous sprint at the 2156 Olympics?&quot; (Sept 2004). Much more important is the reply, also published in Nature under the title &quot;Sprint research runs into a credibility gap&quot; (Nov 2004).


Where the first study claimed that women would surpass men in 2156, the reply pointed out that the analysis, a linear model, made a much more interesting prediction: by about 2636, we should expect to see 100m times less than zero.]]></description>
