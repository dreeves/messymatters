Thanks so much for sharing this. Beautifully done! I added it to the list of other tools at the end of the post for now. Would like to say more about it in the post too. I&#039;m actually wondering if it could make sense to combine these approaches into a single tool that does both.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Readers of the blog post might be interested in a similar google apps script that I put together:  https://github.com/rosulek/gmail-tickler .. The user experience is much more reminiscent of followup.cc, which is mentioned above.

Here, you send email (forward, bcc, etc) to an address like:

yourusername+tickler+jul17@gmail
yourusername+tickler+next+monday@gmail
yourusername+tickler+2weeks@gmail
yourusername+tickler+friday+10am@gmail

etc etc. The threads then reappear in your inbox at the specified time.

Compared to your gmail snoozer, I&#039;d concede that forwarding to an email address is probably a little bit clunkier than applying a label. On the other hand, more flexible syntax is supported (i.e., snoozing an email until &quot;jul 17&quot; without figuring out how many days that is) that would otherwise clutter up your labels namespace. Also, times of day are supported (though limited by the reliability/granularity of google apps&#039; time-triggering of scripts).



Anyone reading this is welcome to try it out and send feedback!]]></description>

Yeah, my problem with it is that if I had the discipline to set an auto-expiry then I might as well get it out of the inbox right then -- often by snoozing it. So, really, snooze is all you need. 


If you had filters for auto-expiry it might be useful. Like &quot;messages containing the word &#039;unsubscribe&#039; get label &#039;x14&#039;&quot; -- so anything likely from a mailing list will take itself out of your inbox in 2 weeks.


I&#039;ll keep experimenting!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/snooze/#comment-180458&quot;&gt;Jan Frederik Léger&lt;/a&gt;.

Yeah, no problem with that. The current implementation bogs down when you have dozens of labels so my workaround is to snooze to an existing label as much as possible.]]></description>

Hmm, I just installed it, so I thought &quot;in theory&quot; that auto-expire is a great feature. I recognize the use case very much: letting a message rotten in my mailbox until it is not relevant anymore.
However, as soon as you have a good inbox-discipline, this feature shouldn&#039;t be necessary anymore.]]></description>
