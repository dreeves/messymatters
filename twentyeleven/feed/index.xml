					<description><![CDATA[You must not have a phone with Siri installed. It is astoundingly functional and useful.

Siri is capable of speeding up computing for some tasks significantly. For example, I can tell her to &quot;remind me to cancel my Amazon.com subscriptions in five months, fifteen days, at 5pm.&quot; Within seconds she correctly understands my request and sets an alarm for 5.5 months in the future; a task that previously would have required a lot of typing and calendar manipulation.

I think that in ten years we will be speaking to computers in natural language, asking them to do things we currently do manually. So instead of googling something or finding a wikipedia article, we&#039;ll ask the computer to do it for us. It&#039;s easier and faster to ask a computer &quot;what is the population of Syria&quot; rather than finding the information with your fingertips.

Ironically this will mean that we will be speaking more to computers than to real people; sending a text will be done with voice (we will still choose to text each other because it is more time-efficient). And in twenty years we will likely be controlling computers with our thoughts; a process that is already possible.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Artificial edeitic memory is doable with today&#039;s technology.

- At a typical youtube bitrate of 768 kb/s, a 64GB CF can hold 8 days of continuous video (with a typical youtube bitrate). That&#039;s enough to offload periodically on a hard drive.

- Cameras are cheap and many are no larger than a penny, they can be fit on glasses easily.

- The lame duck of the lot is battery. Batteries still suck big time. If the CF draws a typical 200 mW, the pinhole camera about 1200 mW and another 600 mW for the encoding chip and you&#039;re up to 2W. A very good rechargeable half a pound lithium-ion battery will get you going 24 hours. 4 pounds will get you going the whole 8 days.

Wiretapping laws are likely to be an even bigger hindrance than carrying around 4 pounds of battery.]]></description>
