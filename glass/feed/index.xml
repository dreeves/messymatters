Thanks very much.  Just placed my order.  We&#039;ll see what can be done with today&#039;s google glass and how it can show the promise for the future.]]></description>

Zach, so sorry, I ran out of invitations! I can tell you though that the bone conduction thing is complete crap. You can hear the computer generated voice fine (as can anyone next to you!) but you can&#039;t have a phone conversation via Glass. It&#039;s so bad that the next iteration apparently has a normal earbud that you can plug in.]]></description>

Invitation on the way! I&#039;ll be pretty surprised if such a social orthotic is possible with google glass any time soon. But I bet it will be possible eventually so I&#039;m highly in favor of such research!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/glass/#comment-179999&quot;&gt;Alexei Andreev&lt;/a&gt;.

I invited you. Sadly, your first idea is not possible with the current hardware. Your second idea -- starting and stopping a timer -- is possible but I&#039;ve found that there&#039;s surprisingly high friction for waking up the device (tapping it or tilting your head) before you can talk to it. I think a Pebble watch would work better for this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m very intrigued by the Google Glasses, particularly to see how the bone conduction works for sound transmission. I&#039;m deaf in my right ear and wear a removable wireless system that uses a device I wear on my back molars to transmit sound. I&#039;m hoping that technology like this will mean one day in the future I can just have my glasses transmit sound from my deaf side. So #mememe ! Zach Paul]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[He Dan,

Mike van Lent here.  I&#039;d be very interested in an invite for Google Glass if you still have any.  I&#039;ve been working on games for autism spectrum assessment and training social skills.  I&#039;m wondering if Google Glass might be useful as a Social Orthotic, making social cues more explicit and helping to translate social cues across cultures.

Thanks,
Mike]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One interesting application I want to see on it is being able to gesture with your fingers to highlight a word or text in real world, and then copy it to some buffer / send it as email / look it up in dictionary. This will speed up physical -&#062; digital text transfer significantly.
Also, doing day-to-day quantified self stuff will be much easier with Glass. &quot;Ok, Glass, start commute timer&quot; or something like that. I&#039;d love to track how I spend my time on granular basis, but it&#039;s too cumbersome/annoying even with a phone right now.

					<description><![CDATA[If you enjoy science fiction, I&#039;d recommend http://vimeo.com/46304267 for some examples of potential Glass apps - in the gamification vein.

Hopefully Google Glass won&#039;t be the Microsoft Tablet PC of tablet computing. Google search results have deteriorated in past years, not improved.]]></description>
