					<description><![CDATA[Any idea when you&#039;ll launch? I think CentMail is a brilliant idea. In addition to all the spam-fighting reasons, I think CentMail has the potential to get people thinking about charity. In particular, research shows that people are more willing to donate to charity if they realize that other people are donating too. So CentMail might actually do a lot of good for the poorest people in the world. That&#039;s a nice win-win: Reduce spam, increase charitable giving. I love it!

When will you launch?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Vishal, we do cite the paper by Thede Loder et al in our technical paper.  And I&#039;m a fan of &lt;a href=&quot;http://boxbe.com&quot;/ rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;boxbe&lt;/a&gt;, too.

Thanks everyone else for all the interest in &lt;a href=&quot;http://centmail.net&quot;/ rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CentMail&lt;/a&gt;!  We&#039;re not sure about any specific charities but hope to have some with international appeal when we launch.  Nothing else about CentMail precludes international users.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read the technical paper and the FAQ. CentMail sounds really promising. I&#039;m very excited about it. Will it be available in other countries? Will I be able to select non-US charities? (e.g. Oxfam in the UK).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, brilliant! Like the inverse of a &quot;safelist&quot; ... let the real email senders pay to charity in order to self-identify. Email clients already do network lookups for Real Time Bl(o)cklists to filter out some of the spam traffic but the Safelist has always been problematic since it required the receiver to be precognitive in order to pass through new senders.]]></description>
