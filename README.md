For the rare times I need to edit an old messymatters post, follow this protocol:

1. treat the etherpad as the master copy and make the edit there first
2. view source on the rendered html from etherpad/expost and copy/paste the relevant bit of html
3. head to github.com/dreeves/messymatters and make the edit to the html file
4. commit it directly to the main branch
5. wait a minute for render.com to automatically see that commit and redeploy
6. confirm that the change is live on messymatters.com
