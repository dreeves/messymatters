					<description><![CDATA[It is not illegal to know more than the insurance company, if you are not responsible for causing the thing you are insuring against.

I know someone who bought temporary health insurance because he was living in a house where two people had just been hospitalized with a potentially infectious disease, with their hospital stays costing thousands of dollars. Two days later, he came down with the same thing. It was entirely legal: he had to sign a statement saying that at the time he bought the insurance, he had no symptoms which would cause a reasonable person to consult a doctor. It was the complete truth. He simply knew that he was likely to get sick for other reasons.

The insurance company paid for his hospital stay, as required by their contract.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Liam, I see, yeah, I guess the way to disambiguate it is to say $100k is the max *coverage* but the $2k is a bonus or penalty on top of whatever the coverage is (I think that was the natural interpretation!). Or scrap the &quot;max coverage&quot; part. $100k is just the max you can write down.

Oh, and note that even if the insurance company pays $99k and $101k they are in fact paying the max of $100k *per claim*. So just think of the $2k not as an adjustment to the coverage but as a transfer between the two claimants.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@dreeves. Sorry, but I don&#039;t agree.  the satement in the original puzzel was that there was a 100K cap on the payment.  Therefore my assertion that 100K was the maximum payout is true.  So if person a says 100K and person b says 99K then a will get 98K and b will get 100K, NOT 101K.  So they go for 99K for absolutely no benefit!

Therefore the logical choice is for both a and b to quote 100K.

Sorry, but that is what the puzzel says. Of course b could go 98K, but again they gain nothing over quoting 100K, except to screw a out of 4,000.  Still not rational.

Cheers

					<description><![CDATA[The optimal algorithm I can use, under the assumption that the opponent is equally rational and will cooperate, is to choose $100K.  If I calculate the expected mutual value of each possible choice given the assumption of a cooperating counter-party, total utility is maximized at $100K.  Further, &quot;Not being a dick&quot; is an important term in my personal utility function.  So I really don&#039;t care if I get 97 and she gets 101, or whatever.]]></description>
