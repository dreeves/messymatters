					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t understand completly your idea of Akrasia horizon. But I&#039;d like to hear from you what you think of what happened to Argentina in the nineties. Economists used to say that Argentina, by put in law the parity 1 peso = 1 dollar, committed itself to be fiscally responsible, after all, if not, there would be a huge crises. And then a lot of money flew to Argentina. But because it was a so perfect mechanism, I mean, it really had to work, they could be lazy, and indeed they were fiscally irresponsible. And, in the end, there was a huge crisis.

Manoel

ps.: I really like this subject. In fact, it&#039;s somewhat related to my B.A thesis (in economics), which was about how economists developed the idea that people evaluate differently present and future (in the works of Bhöm-Bawerk, Irving Fisher and John Bates Clark). I didn&#039;t pursue researching in the subject as a grad student, but I still like it.]]></description>
