					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s my problem with this test. 1.) There exists questions that are directly misleading. For example, the I&#039;m betting the average gestation period for any animal chosen at random is no where near 645 days. Thus since I know nothing about animals I pick a lower value based on the fact that many animals will have a lower gestation period (I may in this case be correct in my 90% confidence interval, note I actually put 700 as my upper threshold so got the question correct). Secondly, I think there is a psychological effect going on here. I don&#039;t want to appear stupid if my upper bound value is MILES from the right answer. That being said I still believe people are overconfident.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[From the data table, I suggest the test result could be better interpreted if we remove data where the true answer is outside the min and max. When no one in the test make a correct guess, it is not about confidence. It could only show the question asked did not fall into their knowledge and the answer entered is a blind-guess.]]></description>
