					<description><![CDATA[interesting post...from a fellow analytics geek. 

You said: &quot;search volume on its own is predictive of future outcomes, but search is nevertheless often outperformed by baseline models trained on publicly available data; combining search and baseline models generally leads to modest improvements.&quot; 

I am curious to see if this continues to hold true as search evolves and tracking improves.  We track trends for customers whose products are seasonal and even regional.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are companies like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hmsinc.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Health Monitoring Systems&lt;/a&gt; that use natural language classifiers over emergency room chief complaints (short text descriptions of symptoms) to add predictors for bio-surveillance (e.g. tracking flu outbreaks, localizing botulism outbreaks, etc.)  

I wonder if search load would be a useful predictor given chief complaint data.  Or the richer data feed that CDC&#039;s now getting.

The problem I&#039;ve seen discussed relative to using search for bio-surveillance is that if a celebrity gets sick, searches for whatever they have spike.  That may not matter for forward prediction, or may itself be predictable given co-searches for the celebrity.]]></description>
