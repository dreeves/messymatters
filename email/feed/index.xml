					<description><![CDATA[@Stone, I disagree! Note the point I opened with about messages going out of sight out of mind. If you star messages then the list of messages with stars (upon thars) is just the old inbox problem all over again!

Btw, thanks for your other excellent comments recently on other posts. Still thinking about those.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Apple&#039;s mail client avoids all of this work. Messages that need to be read later can be flagged; so the inbox becomes a kind of &quot;timeline,&quot; as are common to Facebook and Tumblr. The chore of moving messages to archives or organized into folders is becomes a nonsensical, wasted effort, because messages can be searched effectively or manually browsed quite effectively.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just read this in NYTimes, related to snooze feature (one of them is the one @Chris mentioned):

&quot;there are sites and plug-ins that can manage your e-mail and make it reappear at the top of your in-box at a specified date. Services like Nudgemail, Followup, Followupthen and Boomerang allow you to schedule a message to reappear as new in your in-box later by allowing you to forward the message to yourself with a time delay — from an hour to weeks or months.&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[You should definitely check out my service http://FollowUp.cc./  You can set reminders on emails you send out (Cc or Bcc) or forward emails in your inbox to FollowUp to deal with later.  

The reminders that ping your threads pull it to the top of your inbox and there are one click Snooze Links that you let you defer to deal with it later.

You can also head to the website and review your calendar of reminders in case you want to ping reminders soon and deal with them.  I think it meets a lot of what you&#039;re looking for!  Try it out and let me know, thanks.
